OS/2-version of coinflip v1.0 at http://sourceforge.net.

Minor adjustments, such as:

 - No delay of about 1 second when at least 1 argument is specified,
   for example "coinflip -once_fast"
 - The errorlevel is set to the generated number, so for a backup of
   your files about every 6 days this can be used instead of "grep":

   /* Rexx, flips a coin every 3 days */
   IF Date('B')//3=0 THEN DO 
      '@coinflip.exe > NUL'
      IF rc=1 THEN DO
         SAY 'Please note it is possible that this lines will never execute!'
         /* Insert your backup commands here */
      END
   END
   EXIT

Source and all original files included (coinflip-1.0.tar.gz). 

coinflip flips a coin, prints the result to the screen and sets the
errorlevel accordingly. Use any argument(s) to avoid the delay of
1 second per coin flip.
